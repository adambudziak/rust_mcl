MCL
===

Rust-bindings to the `MCL` pairing-based cryptography library.

`MCL` GitHub: https://github.com/herumi/mcl

## Installation

First install `MCL` using the manual in `herumi/mcl`. You can build the bindings
as a usual cargo crate.

If it compiles, then it should work - it was tested against MCL v1.00 (2019/Sep/30).


### Disclaimer
Currently under heavy development, many bindings are missing and the API may change
significantly.


## TODOs
- [ ] Support the full MCL API.
- [ ] Make the code idiomatic
- [ ] Add the docs and more examples (for now, you can see the `examples/` directory)
